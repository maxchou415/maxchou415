# Hey! You are stepping on my grass.

I am Max, was a full-time Software Engineer. Have worked for few firms in the past 5 years, during my career I was working as a Software Engineer / Director of Software Engineering that mainly focuses on team management and software architecture design. Since Mid-2021 I back to college for more interesting things, I am now studying Computer Science at National Taiwan University.

## Lifestyle 🏖

I love to talk with people who have strong self-cognition. Cooking, hangout with friends, or even having a house party! 🥳
